# FAA PayTracker & Audit System

A local Python-based dashboard to audit paystubs, detect payroll anomalies, and track missed payments during government shutdowns. Coded with the assistance of AI, and not currently ready for any type of real-world use.

## Features

* **Auditing:** Flags if leave balance math isn't correct, if new deduction codes or tax rates shift unexpectedly.
* **Visual Replica:** Recreates the Employee Express paystub but highlights errors with explanatory tooltips.
* **Government Shutdowns:** Includes a "Missed payments Ledger" to project missed paychecks during a shutdown and reconcile them against the eventual "Lump Sum" payout.
* **Graphs and Statistics:** Visualizes various earnings and deductions over time.

## Prerequisites

You need Python installed. This project relies on the following libraries:

**1. For the Server & Dashboard (Desktop)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
````

**2. For the Mobile App**

Modify DEFAULT_IP in mobile_app.py to match `hostname -I` output from your console

Test:
```bash
flet run mobile_app.py --web --port 8550
````

Build the mobile app:
```bash
flet build apk --project "Audit FAA" --module-name mobile_app
````

Look for app-release.apk located in /build/apk and transfer that to your phone, then install it


## Folder Structure

Ensure your project folder looks like this:

```
PayTracker/
├── PayStubs/          # <--- Drop your HTML files here
├── dashboard.py       # The visualization app
├── mobile_app.py      # Logic for the android app
├── payroll_audit.db   # (Created automatically, database for desktop)
└── mobile_data.db     # (Created automatically, database for mobile app)
```

## How to Use

### 1\. Prepare Your Data

1.  Log in to Employee Express.
2.  Open your Earnings and Leave Statement.
3.  View page source, save the raw HTML in the format YYYY-MM-DD.html in the PayStubs folder

### 2\. Ingest the Data

Run the ingestion script to parse the HTML files and build the database.

```bash
python3 ingest.py
```

*Note: You can also trigger this button from the "Ingestion" tab inside the dashboard.*

### 3\. Launch the Dashboard

Start the visual interface:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Your browser will open to `http://localhost:8501`.

## The Workflow

### The "Audit & Time" Tab

  * Shutdown Reconciliation: Tracks payments to ensure the gov. completely paid you back
  * Deep Dive Audit: See past, current and future payperiods, enter schedules, OT, OJTI, etc. 
  * "Your Calculation" a paystub generated by hours you input yourself, to project what your paystub SHOULD be for any given pay period
  * "Official Paystub" the paystub generated by Employee Express which you can use to compare against your projected paystub.

### The "Statistics & Graphs" Tab

  * Graph of various earnings and deductions

## The "Basic Facts" tab

  * Enter your schedule for the year, and it will also show you holidays (actual day vs your holiday based on your schedule) 

## The "Ingestion" tab

  * When you add a new paystub you can press "scan" here instead of manually running ingest.py
